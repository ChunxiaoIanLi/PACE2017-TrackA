This repository is primarily for PACE 2017 submissions.

This repository contains both exact and heuristic submissions.

As of May 1, 2017, the exact submission is fairly stable while the
heuristic submission is still under substantial improvement efforts.

The exact algorithm implements the algorithm proposed in:
Tamaki, Hisao. "Positive-instance driven dynamic programming for treewidth." 
arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.05286 (2017).

If you use the implementation provided in this repository in research work,
please cite the above paper and or this repository in your publication reporting
the work.

Usage: 
$ make exact
for making the exact submission
$ make heuristic
for making the heuristic submission, or
$ make
for making both

The commands are tw-exact and tw-heuristic as specified by the challenge rule.
These commands are implemented as shell scripts.
